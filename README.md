A PHP library for working with the [DaPulse API](https://developers.dapulse.com/). This project is provided to work with the API in an easy fashion instead of manually making the calls to the API.

**Notice:** This library is still under heavy development and there's still a lot that I need to write. I will be updating this README and the Wiki with examples as I finish writing the functionality. I ask that you please hold off on feature requests until I make the initial release of this library. If you'd like to show your support or interest, star and/or watch this repository to follow it's development. Thank you!

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3+

## Getting Help

To get help, see if our [wiki](https://github.com/allejo/PhpPulse/wiki) has any information regarding your question. If the wiki can't help you, you may either [create an issue](https://github.com/allejo/PhpPulse/issues) or stop by IRC; I'm available on IRC as "allejo" so feel free to ping me. I recommend creating an issue in case others have the same question but for quick help, IRC works just fine.

To report a bug or request a feature, please submit an issue.
